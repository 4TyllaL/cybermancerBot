# cybermancerBot
Telegram bot created to perform some tasks. Code created to learn the bot library for telegram
This code was created with the aim of learning how to use the bot library for Telegram in order to venture into the world of bots and virtual assistants. Libs and consumption of simple APIs were used, such as openwearther for climate queries, openAi to allow the bot to answer the most diverse questions and a password generator function.

The purpose of this bot was to bring together all my Python codes and a single solution that could be accessed via Telegram.
